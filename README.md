# Pewlett Hackard Employee Database

A data engineering project to analyze employee records from the 1980s and 1990s at the fictional company, Pewlett Hackard. This project involves database schema design, data import, and SQL querying to gain insights from archived employee data.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Modeling**: Inspect CSV files and create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to define table relationships.
2. **Data Engineering**: Design SQL schema, set primary and foreign keys, and import CSV data.
3. **Data Analysis**: Run SQL queries to answer questions about employee details, hiring dates, managers, departments, and common last names.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Database Setup**:
   - Create a new SQL database.
   - Use the schema file to define tables.
   - Import CSV files into the database.

3. **Run Queries**: Execute queries in `queries.sql` to generate insights.

## Analysis Queries

- List employee details (number, name, sex, salary).
- Identify employees hired in 1986.
- List department managers.
- Show employee departments.
- List employees named Hercules with last names starting with “B”.
- List employees in Sales and Development departments.
- Frequency count of last names in descending order.

## Requirements

- SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- ERD Tool (e.g., QuickDBD)
